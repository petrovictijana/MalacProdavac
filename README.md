# MalacProdavac

A mobile app connecting small-scale producers with consumers.

This application was developed using **Kotlin** for the front-end, **Java** (**SpringBoot**) for the back-end, and **Python** for data simulation.

My contributions:
- Database design (MySQL)
- Development of the back-end part of the application (Java - SpringBoot)
- Work on the data simulator, responsible for generating a large volume of data to enable thorough testing and proper presentation of the app (Python)
